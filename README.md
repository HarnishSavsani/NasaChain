# What it does:
* Used ML algorithm along with NASA data to predict if a person is safe or not 
* Increases collaboration between different legal entities.
* In Case of disaster, it enable the organisations to manage the help that they are providing.
* Reduces delays in services.
* No middle party
* Tries to guarantee the resources are actually available to the people
* Helps to settle Insurance claims in case of Disaster.

# STEPS to Install / Setup
1) Clone the repositories https://github.com/HarnishSavsani/NasaChain using following command
git clone https://github.com/HarnishSavsani/NasaChain
2) do run "npm install" command to ensure node packages are up-to-date & in sync
3) Ensure you have "Ganache" & It is running status
4) Ensure you have "MetaMask" extensions added into chrome & enabled custom RPC to sync the accounts with Ganache
5) Using below command to deploy the contract into Ganache
   truffle migrate --network ganache --compile-all --reset
6) Once it is migrated successfully, run below command to launch the server
   npm run dev


# Implementation:
* Developed using Solidity and web3.js
  * used node.js, web3 and solc compiler
  * used Remix for contract testing
  * Used truffle framework in order to the ease developement process
* Testing of smart contracts was done on 
  * Ganache (Private Local Blockchain)
* Testing was done using javascript instead of a solidity contract creation way.
* Javascript testing method used the Mocha framework
  
# Build With:
* Solidity,IPFS, MetaMask, Web3js, Truffle, Ganache, Shell script, EVM Framework. JQuery, 

# Future Enhancements:
* Will be using advanced machine learning algorithms to increase the predictions of Landslides in the areas.
* Updating the Smart Contract, as of now it's a very basic smart contract.
* Actual Implementation
